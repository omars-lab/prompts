# Prompt Maturity Analysis

There are a set of questions I should ask myself about each prompt to determine their maturity and ideate potential enhancements. These include:

## Core Maturity Questions
* How mature is the prompt?
* Does it emit usage metrics?
* Does it emit time-saving metrics? (prompt performed X amount of edits so far, it would have taken me XYZ minutes to think through and do the same)

## Self-Healing
* Is the prompt self-healing?
* Can the prompt reference itself and update itself when given feedback during execution?
* Does the prompt modify its own instructions when critical issues are raised by the user?
* Are there mechanisms for the prompt to revise its approach mid-execution based on real-time feedback?
* Can the prompt detect when it's going off-track and self-correct its behavior?
* Does the prompt have the ability to learn from execution failures and update its strategy?
* Are there built-in mechanisms for the prompt to evolve its instructions based on user corrections?

## Feedback Loops
* Does the prompt have a feedback loop?
* Are there mechanisms to capture user feedback on prompt effectiveness?
* Does the prompt learn from previous interactions and improve over time?
* Are there automated feedback collection systems in place?
* Does the prompt provide opportunities for users to rate or comment on outputs?
* Is feedback systematically analyzed and used for prompt improvements?

## Clarity & Intent
* Is the prompt's intent and purpose crystal clear?
* Are the required inputs clearly specified and well-defined?
* Are the expected outputs clearly described with format requirements?
* Is the definition of success for this prompt unambiguous?
* Does the prompt eliminate ambiguity about what constitutes completion?
* Does the prompt provide the AI with an adequate role or persona to play?

## Quality & Documentation
* Does the prompt include examples (both positive and negative)?
* How well is the prompt documented?
* Does it handle edge cases and error scenarios?
* Is the prompt reusable across different contexts?
* Does the prompt have validation steps to verify output quality?
* Is the prompt optimized for efficiency (token usage vs. quality)?

## Consistency
* Will the prompt yield consistent outputs across multiple runs?
* Does the prompt maintain consistent quality regardless of input variations?
* Are the output formats and structures standardized and predictable?
* Does the prompt handle similar inputs in a consistent manner?
* Are there mechanisms to ensure consistent behavior across different contexts?
* Does the prompt produce reliable results when used by different users?

## Iteration & Improvement
* Does the prompt have version control or iteration tracking?
* Are there clear criteria for what constitutes success vs failure?
* Does the prompt include guidance for improvement based on results?

## Metrics Collection
* Does the prompt include built-in instructions for self-reporting metrics?
* Does it track time savings estimates from the user's perspective?
* Does it collect quality self-assessments (confidence levels, revision counts)?
* Are there mechanisms to gather user feedback on prompt effectiveness?
* Does the prompt system integrate with external usage tracking tools?
* Are metrics standardized across similar prompts for comparison?
* Does the prompt track tool confusion incidents and resolution patterns?
* Are feedback loop iteration counts and improvement rates measured?

## Tool Use & Ambiguity
* Does the prompt minimize tool ambiguity and confusion?
* Are tool selection criteria clearly defined and unambiguous?
* Does the prompt provide guidance on when to use specific tools?
* Are there fallback instructions for when tools fail or are unavailable?
* Does the prompt include validation steps to verify tool outputs?
* Are tool usage patterns consistent and predictable?
* Does the prompt track tool usage metrics and success rates?

## Maturity Levels
- **Experimental**: Basic functionality, minimal testing
- **Developing**: Core features work, some edge cases handled
- **Mature**: Well-tested, documented, includes examples and feedback loops
- **Production**: Fully documented, self-healing, metrics-driven, continuously improved
