> The latest commit by tk dang consolidated two SDS (Self-Service Data) AJAX calls into one. Here's what changed:

Modified files:
‚Ä¢ Urls.java - 2 lines changed (1 addition, 1 deletion)
‚Ä¢ SDSFormDataController.java - 215 lines added (new file)
‚Ä¢ SDSFormEligibilityController.java - 94 lines deleted (removed file)
‚Ä¢ SDSFormDataResponse.java - 14 lines added
‚Ä¢ SDSFormDataControllerTest.java - 553 lines added (new test file)
‚Ä¢ SDSFormEligibilityControllerTest.java - 202 lines deleted (removed test file)

Summary: The commit refactored the SDS form handling by merging two separate controllers (SDSFormEligibilityController and functionality into a
single SDSFormDataController), resulting in a net addition of 486 lines of code. This consolidation likely improves maintainability and reduces the
number of AJAX endpoints needed for SDS form operations.

> anything weird about the change? Any improvement suggestinos?

> Let me examine the actual changes to identify any potential issues or improvement opportunities.

> Based on my analysis, here are the potential issues and improvement suggestions:

## Issues Found:

1. Exception Handling Anti-pattern: The getLinkTreeData method has a catch (Exception e) { throw e; } block that serves no purpose and should be
removed.

2. Inconsistent Error Handling: The main method catches FormDataException separately but then has a generic Exception catch that also handles the
same custom exception type.

3. TODO Comment: There's an unfinished TODO about getting datetime of latest tracking event, indicating incomplete functionality.

4. Hardcoded Values: The ELIGIBLE_DRIVER_TYPES set only contains "DA_FLEX" - this might need to be configurable.

## Improvement Suggestions:

1. Remove redundant catch block:
java
// Remove this from getLinkTreeData method:
} catch (Exception e) {
    throw e;  // This does nothing useful
}


2. Simplify exception handling in the main method - either handle FormDataException specifically or let it bubble up to the generic handler.

3. Extract magic strings like "DA_FLEX" to constants or configuration.

4. Add input validation for the isDeeplinkIngress parameter parsing to avoid potential NullPointerException.

5. Consider using ResponseEntity instead of manually serializing JSON responses for better Spring integration.

The consolidation itself is good - reducing two endpoints to one improves maintainability and reduces client complexity. The logic appears sound,
but the exception handling could be cleaner.

Do the tests have proper coverage?
